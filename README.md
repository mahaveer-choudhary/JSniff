# üîç JavaScript Secret Scanner

A Python tool for scanning JavaScript files in web applications to detect exposed API keys, tokens, secrets, and credentials using powerful regex-based pattern matching.

## Features

- Automatic JavaScript Discovery ‚Äì Extracts and scans all `.js` files linked in a web page
- Regex-Based Secret Detection ‚Äì Includes 100+ built-in regex patterns for various API keys and tokens
- Custom Headers ‚Äì Add custom headers (like Authorization or Cookies) to bypass restrictions
- Random User-Agent Rotation ‚Äì Uses a random User-Agent for each scan request
- Colorized Terminal Output ‚Äì Easily spot detected secrets in colored output
- Handles Obfuscated JS ‚Äì Beautifies JavaScript for more accurate pattern matching


## üß† How it works

- Takes a target URL as input

- Fetches the page and extracts all `.js` file URLs

- Sends requests to each JavaScript file

- Beautifies and scans the content using regex patterns

- Prints matches (if any) with the name of the detected secret
